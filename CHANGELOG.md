### Known Issues
**IMPORTANT**
- The note generation is not well defined for the duration timing.
- Lack of BPM definition; an automatic calculation function will be added.
- Something else I don't know or don't remember yet *.*

**LESS IMPORTANT**
- Starting and then stopping the conversion causes a bug, preventing the program from being reused. It is necessary to restart the program for a new use. xD
- Some users may experience occasional flash glitches during video processing on preview window, which are not a cause for concern.
- Something else I don't know or don't remember yet *.*
